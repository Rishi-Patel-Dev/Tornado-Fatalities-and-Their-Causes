This analysis centers on a tornado dataset derived from information produced by NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center. NOAA (the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) is one of the most respected sources for environmental and meteorological data in the United States. This dataset has been streamlined to focus on essential factors associated with tornado activity, including their frequency, location, intensity, and impact. Tornado data like this is crucial for understanding patterns in tornado behavior, helping to improve preparedness and response strategies, and assessing the effects of tornados over time and across regions.

The dataset includes columns representing the date, location, magnitude, injuries, fatalities, and physical attributes of each tornado (such as latitude, longitude, length, and width). This information provides a comprehensive overview of tornados from their point of origin to the end of their paths, along with metrics on the physical impact they caused. One unique feature of this dataset is that it spans several decades, covering both the period when tornados were rated using the F-scale (prior to 2007) and the period when the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale was implemented. This shift allows for an examination of tornados across a significant historical timeline while also presenting a unique opportunity to explore any impact of the new rating system.

Given this data, one particularly interesting question is to examine whether there are observable trends in tornado severity over time. Specifically, has the magnitude of tornados, as measured by the `mag` variable, changed over the years? By analyzing magnitude trends over different periods, we can assess whether tornados are becoming more or less intense on average, especially following the adoption of the EF scale in 2007.

Another key question involves exploring the geographic distribution of tornado occurrences and their associated impacts. Which states experience the highest number of tornados, and how does this frequency relate to the rates of injuries and fatalities in each state? By comparing tornado counts and severity outcomes across different regions, we can better understand where tornados cause the most damage and identify areas with higher risks of injury and fatality. This dataset’s extensive temporal and geographic range makes it a valuable resource for tracking tornado patterns and evaluating regional differences, which can inform both scientific research and public safety planning.
